Previous findings are contradictory. We provide a potential explanation using evidence from a field experiment. In a door-to-door solicitation, men and women are equally generous, but women become less generous when it becomes easy to avoid the solicitor. Our structural estimates of the social preference parameters suggest an explanation: women are more likely to be on the margin of giving, partly because of a less dispersed distribution of altruism. We find similar results for the willingness to complete an unpaid survey: women are more likely to be on the margin of participation.

We design a field experiment to estimate a model of voting `because others will ask&#39;. The expectation of being asked motivates turnout if individuals derive pride from telling others that they voted, or feel shame from admitting that they did not vote, provided that lying is costly. In a door-to-door survey about election turnout, we experimentally vary (i) the informational content and use of a flyer pre-announcing the survey, (ii) the duration and payment for the survey, and (iii) the incentives to lie about past voting. The experimental results indicate significant social image concerns. For the 2010 Congressional election, we estimate a value of voting ‘to tell others’ of about $15, contributing 2 percentage points to turnout. Lastly, we evaluate a get-out-the-vote intervention in which we tell potential voters that we will ask if they voted.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Leonardo Bursztyn, Bruno Ferman, Stefano Fiorin and Martin Kanz)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Quarterly Journal of Economics, August 2018</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(2)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_2"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_2" style="display:none;">: This paper provides novel field-experimental evidence on status goods. We work with an Indonesian bank that markets platinum credit cards to high-income customers. In a first experiment, we show that demand for the platinum card greatly exceeds demand for a nondescript control product with identical benefits, suggesting demand for the pure status aspect of the card. Transaction data reveal that platinum cards are more likely to be used in social contexts, implying social image motivations. Combining price variation with information on the use of the card sheds light on the magnitude of the demand for social status. In a second experiment, we provide evidence of positional externalities from the consumption of these status goods.  The final experiment shows that increasing self-esteem causally reduces demand for status goods. We infer that part of the demand for status is psychological in nature, and that social image is a substitute for self image.

Using administrative data, lab and field experiments to measure outcomes, I find that having poor classmates makes rich students (i) more prosocial, generous and egalitarian; and (ii) less likely to discriminate against poor students, and more willing to socialize with them. These effects are driven by personal interactions between rich and poor students. In contrast, I find mixed but overall modest impacts on rich students&#39; academic achievement.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(5)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_5"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_5" style="display:none;">: Why are people living in poverty disproportionately affected by mental illness? We review the interdisciplinary evidence of the bi-directional causal relationship between poverty and common mental illnesses -- depression and anxiety -- and the underlying mechanisms. Research shows that mental illness reduces employment and therefore income and that psychological interventions generate economic gains. Similarly, negative economic shocks cause mental illness, and anti-poverty programs such as cash transfers improve mental health. A crucial next step toward the design of effective policies is to better understand the mechanisms underlying these causal effects.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>American Economic Review, May 2021</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(6)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_6"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_6" style="display:none;">: Can research findings change political leaders&#39; beliefs and cause policy change? Collaborating with the National Confederation of Municipalities in Brazil, we work with 2,150 municipalities and their mayors. We use experiments to measure mayors&#39; demand for research information and their response to learning research findings. In one experiment, we find that mayors and other municipal officials are personally willing to pay to learn the results of impact evaluations, and update their beliefs when informed of the findings. They value larger-sample studies more, while not distinguishing on average between studies conducted in rich and poor countries. In a second experiment, we find that informing mayors about research on a simple and effective policy (reminder letters for taxpayers) increases the probability that their municipality implements the policy by 10 percentage points. In sum, we provide direct evidence that policy-makers value research information, change their beliefs when presented with it, and that this can drive policy change. Information frictions may thus help explain  failures to adopt effective policies.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Pedro Bessone, Frank Schilbach, Heather Schofield and Mattie Toma)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Quarterly Journal of Economics, August 2021</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(7)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_7"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_7" style="display:none;">: The urban poor in developing countries face challenging living environments, which may interfere with good sleep. Using actigraphy to measure sleep objectively, we find that low-income adults in Chennai, India sleep only 5.5 hours per night on average despite spending 8 hours in bed. Their sleep is highly interrupted, with sleep efficiency—sleep per time in bed—comparable to those with disorders such as sleep apnea or insomnia. A randomized three-week treatment providing information, encouragement, and improvements to home sleep environments increased sleep duration by 27 minutes per night by inducing more time in bed. Contrary to expert predictions and a large body of sleep research, increased nighttime sleep had no detectable effects on cognition, productivity, decision-making, or well-being, and led to small decreases in labor supply. In contrast, short afternoon naps at the workplace improved an overall index of outcomes by 0.12 standard deviations, with significant increases in productivity, psychological well-being, and cognition, but a decrease in work time.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(8)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_8"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_8" style="display:none;">: Recent progress in sleep science has greatly improved our understanding of the neurobiology of sleep and its importance for physical and mental functioning. Lab experiments have shown that insufficient sleep causes declines in cognitive and physiological function, and community studies have documented widespread sleep deprivation. Adults in the US sleep just 6.1 hours per night when objectively measured, well below the 7 to 9 hours recommended by experts. Evidence is emerging that sleep duration and quality are even lower in developing countries and among the poor in rich countries. This has led to predictions that increased sleep would have profound benefits for society, including increased productivity, academic performance, health, and safety. Why do people not sleep more, given these predicted benefits?

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Liang Bai, Benjamin Handel and Ted Miguel)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Review of Economics and Statistics, Dec 2021</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(9)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_9"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_9" style="display:none;">: Self-control problems constitute a potential explanation for the under-investment in preventive health in low-income countries. Behavioral economics offers a tool to solve such problems: commitment devices. We conduct a field experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of theoretically-motivated commitment contracts in increasing preventive doctor visits by hypertensive patients in rural India. Despite achieving high take-up of such contracts in some treatment arms, we find no effects on actual doctor visits or individual health outcomes. A substantial number of individuals pay for commitment but fail to follow through on the doctor visit, losing money without experiencing health benefits. We develop and structurally estimate a pre-specified model of consumer behavior under present bias with varying levels of naivete. The results are consistent with a large share of individuals being partially naive about their own self-control problems: sophisticated enough to demand some commitment, but overly optimistic about whether a given level of commitment is sufficiently strong to be effective. The results suggest that commitment devices may in practice be welfare diminishing, at least in some contexts, and serve as a cautionary tale about their role in health care.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">Current Version: August 2021</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>American Economic Review, March 2022</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(10)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_10"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_10" style="display:none;">: We design three field experiments to estimate the nature and magnitude of workers’ social preferences towards their employers. The experiments vary the return to the employer and employer generosity towards workers (“gifts”). Including variation in pay rates—either piece rates or wage rates—allows us to estimate the elasticity of work outcomes and benchmark the workers&#39; social preferences toward the employer. The first experiment measures productivity—units of output produced in a fixed amount of time. The second and third experiments measure the willingness to do extra work. We document that productivity is rather unresponsive to financial incentives, while the willingness to perform extra work is very responsive. In terms of social preferences, we document, first, that workers exert effort for their employer even in the absence of private incentives, but are insensitive to the return to the employer. This result is consistent with models of warm glow or social norms regarding work effort, but not pure altruism towards the employer. Second, while we do not detect any effect of the gifts in the productivity experiment, we find moderate positive impacts in the extra-work experiments. We show that this difference is partly explained by the disparate elasticities of productivity and extra work.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(11)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_11"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_11" style="display:none;">: We study social learning between spouses using an experiment in Chennai, India. We vary whether individuals discover information themselves or must instead learn what their spouse discovered via a discussion. Women treat their `own&#39; and their husband&#39;s information the same. In sharp contrast, men&#39;s beliefs respond less than half as much to information that was discovered by their wife. This is not due to a lack of communication: husbands put less weight on their wife&#39;s signals even when perfectly informed of them. In a second experiment, when paired with mixed- and same-gender strangers, \textit{both} men and women heavily discount their teammate&#39;s information relative to their own. We conclude that people have a  tendency to underweight others&#39; information relative to their own. The marital context creates a countervailing force for women, resulting in a gender difference in learning (only)  in the household.
